#Challenges

The first hump that we had to overcome was the download of pip and pygame. Although generally the download of pyhton
includes pip, Tom's computer did not do that. The manipulation of some files was believed to be the downfall for Tom
and he had to delete everything that had to do with the software off of his computer. The next step was creating snake. 
We were able to get a base snake game and incorperate the first mine fairly easily. After this, however, we got stuck 
trying figure a way to have more and more mines pop up. The reasoning behind this was due to the length of the code.
After a very in-depth look into the snake game, we found that we virtually had to reset the game in a series of if 
statements that allowed us to increase the number of mines by having each if statement incorperate more and more mine 
variables. The next thing we had to overcome was making sure the mines and food were randomly moving as anything,
food or mine was collected. To do this we had to find that each mine and food had to present in the if statements 
depicting the change in size of the snake based on collecting food or mines. After these road-blocks, we were able to 
effectively create a snake game that creatively increased in difficulty as the game moved along.
