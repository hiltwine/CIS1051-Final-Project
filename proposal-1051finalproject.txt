# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake Wars

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Spin on snake in which there are mines/obstacles to avoid.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software we are creating will create a snake game. This snake game will encoroperate obstacles into the orginal form of snake. There will be food that will make the snake grow, and mines that will make the snake shorter. The food and mines will be placed using the random import.There will be a funtion that shows what the snake can touch as there will be barriers you must avoid as you consume more food and grow. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We would like to, at the least, create a snake game mode in which the mines are present that can end the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome would be to have the food and mines, but the mines shrink the snake by one instead of ending the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to have a working snake base with mines that shrink the snake by one if touched. On top of this, there will be barriers that become more frequent as more food is collected. If the barrier is touched then the game ends.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps to the project is navigating some new libraries that we have not covered as of now. The libraries are time and pygame. We will need too conduct research on how to customize the output screen in order to have a running score and our own theme. As a team of two, our next steps should be one of us beginning to build and understand the snake game, while the other begins to brainstorm on how we will work with the mines and barriers. We should also decide on a theme to make the output screen aesthetically pleasing.
