#### What have you done for your project so far?

The base snake game is finished. There is a functioning score board that tracks the orbs consumed.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need to develop the mines that will deduct points when consumed. We need to create a means of having mines more mines appear as the players score gets higher.

We need the mines to appear randomly.
